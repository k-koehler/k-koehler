### Why you lookin' at my profile??

It's okay. I'm pretty popular.

I'm an experienced senior engineer with 10+ years of experience with most web-dev related technologies (React, React Native, Node, Python, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.). My first job was as an AI engineer and I also stay up to date with LLMs and innovations to the transformer architecture!

While you're here take a look at some of my projects:

- `gguf-tensor-optimizer`: Optimally allocate tensors to your backend devices in `llama.cpp` or `ik_llama.cpp` without worrying about complex `-ot <regex>` arguments
- `multillama`: serve multiple OpenAI compatible servers at once with a single line of code
- `bayes-text-classifier`: machine learning in javascript?? you gotta check this out
- `kwix`: build object-oriented typescript backends in nodejs
- `kneo4j`: database driver for Neo4J with some nice features, like automatic schema mapping
