### Why you lookin' at my profile??

It's okay. I'm pretty popular.

I am a full-stack typescript enthusiast. My goal is spread the holy word of typescript and usher in a new glorious dawn where no-one will ever again google `TypeError: Cannot read property 'xxx' of undefined`.

While you're here take a look at some of my projects:

- `kwix`: build object-oriented typescript backends in nodejs
- `bayes-text-classifier`: machine learning in javascript?? you gotta check this out
- `mersenne-hash-table`: you like math? heard of mersenne numbers? go check it out now wtf are you waiting for
- `kneo4j`: database driver for Neo4J with some nice features, like automatic schema mapping
